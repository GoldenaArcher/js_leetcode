github repo 地址: <https://github.com/GoldenaArcher/js_leetcode>，Github 的目录 ~~大概~~ 会更新的更勤快一些。

题目地址：[394. Decode String](https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-string/)

## 题目

如下：

> Given an encoded string, return its decoded string.
>
> The encoding rule is: `k[encoded_string]`, where the `encoded_string` inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly `k` times. Note that `k` is guaranteed to be a positive integer.
>
> You may assume that the input string is always valid; there are no extra white spaces, square brackets are well-formed, etc. Furthermore, you may assume that the original data does not contain any digits and that digits are only for those repeat numbers, `k`. For example, there will not be input like `3a` or `2[4]`.
>
> The test cases are generated so that the length of the output will never exceed `10^5`.
